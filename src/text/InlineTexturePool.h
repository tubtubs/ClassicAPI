// One pooled CSimpleTexture per visible inline icon, anchored RELATIVE TO THE
// OWNING FONTSTRING at offsets converted from pen space via the fs+0x7C scale
// bridge (see InlineTexture.cpp's FlushLayout). Engine-drawn → resident by
// construction (no VRAM-eviction flicker); engine-anchored → tracks the
// fontstring's movement for free.

// Computed entirely at PAINT time — icon coords and fs rect read in the same
// flush, a coherent snapshot — so the pool applies it verbatim with no
// apply-time rect read (an apply-time read raced the chat relayout after
// SetText and parked icons off their line, where the dedup froze them: the
// scroll-landing "randomly hidden icon" bug). Relative offsets are also
// position-invariant, so scrolling a line re-queues nothing.

// every paint is cheap. An empty vector hides the fontstring's regions; a
// hidden fontstring's regions are hidden automatically each tick.

// from the SMF-refresh hook so a chat line's icons are placed before the frame
// draws, killing the one-frame lag. Deduped against the current want, so a
// no-change re-apply is a cheap no-op. Faults are caught (latches the same
// maintenance kill switch as the tick path).
