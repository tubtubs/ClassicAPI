// Backport of the TBC+ `UNIT_SPELLCAST_*` events to 1.12, for the local
// player. The underlying cast/channel detection already exists in
// `Spell::Cast` (it hooks every relevant path for `UnitCastingInfo` /
// `UnitChannelInfo`); this module turns those state transitions into the
// retail-named Lua events so ported cast-bar / rotation addons work.
//
// MinHook allows one hook per target and `Spell::Cast` already owns the
// cast-related hooks, so this module doesn't hook anything — the hook
// owners call into it. Cast start/stop/channel/pushback are derived by
// polling `Spell::Cast`'s player state once per frame (`PollPlayer`,
// called from that module's `OnWorldTick`); succeeded/interrupted come
// from the SPELL_GO / abort paths in later slices.
//
// Event contract (arg1 is always the unit token):
//   (unitTarget, castGUID, spellID, spellName, rank)
// The first three match the modern Classic-Era signature, so addons
// written against it read `unit, castGUID, spellID` and work; `spellName`
// / `rank` are ClassicAPI extension tail args. `castGUID` is a synthesized
// unique-per-cast string ("Cast-<n>") — not retail's GUID format, just
// stable across a cast's events so START can be paired with STOP.
//
// Every fire is gated on `Event::Custom::HasListeners`, so when no addon
// registers for these the module costs one pointer-compare per transition
// and does no arg synthesis.

// Detects, against the previous snapshot:

// End-time movement covers both pushback (SMSG_SPELL_DELAYED) and the
// confirming SMSG_SPELL_START reconciling the client-predicted cast time to
// the server's (ranged-haste-scaled Steady/Aimed Shot, pfUI#43) — DELAYED is
// the "re-read the times" trigger, whichever way the end moved.
// Channels never fire INTERRUPTED — retail emits only CHANNEL_STOP for a
// channel whether it ends naturally or is cut short.

// SPELL_GO hook (`Aura::Source`) when the caster is the player — that
// packet is "the spell went off," so it fires for instants (which never
// touch the cast state above) as well as completed cast-time / channel
// spells. Reuses the in-flight cast's castGUID when the spellID matches,
// else mints a fresh one (instant cast). For channels it defers to

// CHANNEL_START); no-ops if the channel isn't tracked yet (an UPDATE never
// precedes its START). The end time itself is read via

// now" trigger.

// tracked as casting this spell. It's the SAME string the cast's events carry
// (`SENT`/`START`/…), so `C_Spell.UnitCastingInfo`'s `castID` return can pull
// it from here and stay consistent with the events. `casterGuid` is the local
// player's GUID for own casts, or the remote caster's GUID. Channels are
// excluded (retail's UnitChannelInfo has no castID).

// `UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT` is handled internally — the module subscribes to
// the shared `Net::SendObserver` and fires it when CMSG_CAST_SPELL leaves
// the client (the earliest point in a cast's life). The castGUID minted
// there threads forward: the matching START / SUCCEEDED / FAILED reuse it,
// so all of a cast's events share one guid.

// ---- Phase 2: non-player (remote) units --------------------------------
//
// Remote casts have a narrower data surface than the player's: vanilla only
// broadcasts a caster's cast via SMSG_SPELL_START (+ SPELL_GO at completion)
// and its abort via the failure packets / ClearCastingSpell choke point. So
// remotes get START / STOP / CHANNEL_START / CHANNEL_STOP / SUCCEEDED /
// INTERRUPTED, but NOT SENT / DELAYED / FAILED / CHANNEL_UPDATE (that data
// is caster-only or client-local and never reaches an observer — see the
// remote-unit limitations in CLAUDE.md).
//
// `Spell::Cast` owns the remote-cast packet hooks; it calls these at the
// transition points, and each event is fanned out to EVERY unit token the
// caster GUID currently maps to (target / focus / nameplateN / party / raid /
// mouseover), via `Unit::Identity::TokensForGUID`. Each remote cast gets its
// own synthesized castGUID, shared across its events.

// A remote unit began a cast (SMSG_SPELL_START). `endMs` is the computed end
// (server castTime, or channel duration); `isChannel` selects
// CHANNEL_START/STOP vs START/STOP. Called only for real bars — pure instants
// (no cast time, not a channel) are skipped by the caller. Fired from the
// poll so START lands at frame time in the right order.
void OnRemoteCastStart(uint64_t casterGuid, int spellID, int endMs,
                       bool isChannel);

// A remote unit's spell went off (SMSG_SPELL_GO). Marks the tracked cast so
// the poll fires SUCCEEDED (then STOP) in order; if there's no tracked cast
// (an instant, which sends no SPELL_START) fires SUCCEEDED immediately with a
// fresh castGUID.
void OnRemoteSucceeded(uint64_t casterGuid, int spellID);

// A remote unit's cast was aborted (failure packet / ClearCastingSpell). The
// poll fires INTERRUPTED + STOP (or CHANNEL_STOP) for it next frame.
void OnRemoteAborted(uint64_t casterGuid, int spellID);

// Per-frame driver for remote cast events — fires START/CHANNEL_START, then
// SUCCEEDED, then STOP/CHANNEL_STOP/INTERRUPTED in modern order as each
// tracked remote cast transitions, and expires casts at their computed end.
// Called from `Spell::Cast::OnWorldTick` after `PollPlayer`.
