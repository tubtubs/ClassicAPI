// C++ entry to the cast-at-unit primitive behind `C_Spell.CastAtUnit`, so
// other C++ modules (the Frame attribute click dispatcher's `spell` verb) can
// cast a spell at a unit without a Lua round-trip through the global table.
//
// Both feed the unit's GUID straight to the engine's cast dispatcher — a
// unit-target/normal spell fires directly on the unit (no current-target
// juggling). `placeGroundSpell` decides what a ground-target spell does: place
// it at the unit's feet, or leave the reticle up for the player to click (the
// aim they already had). Returns true when the spell was cast. Safe to call
// from inside a Lua C function: a genuinely unknown token raises the engine's
// standard "Unknown unit" error in the resolver, caught by the enclosing
// protected call.

namespace Spell::AtUnit {

// Cast by name ("(Rank N)"-aware — `"Blizzard"` is the highest known rank).
bool CastByName(const char *spellName, const char *unitToken, bool placeGroundSpell);

// Cast the exact numeric spellID (a specific rank).
bool CastByID(int spellID, const char *unitToken);
