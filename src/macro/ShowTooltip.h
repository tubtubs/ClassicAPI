// `#showtooltip` / `#show` for action-bar macros.
//
// The engine caches one "primary spell" per macro (`MacroEntry +
// OFF_MACRO_PRIMARY_SPELL`, pet flag at `+IS_PET`) and its slot→spell helper
// (`FUN_ACTION_SLOT_TO_SPELL`) returns it for every macro slot — so cooldown,
// usable, range, current and auto-repeat state for a macro button all follow
// that one field. Vanilla only ever fills it from the first `/cast` line.
//
// This module resolves a macro's `#showtooltip [conditions] value` (or `#show`,
// or the bare form that reads the first `/cast` / `/use` line) on the world
// tick — conditionals evaluated by the Lua `SecureCmdOptionParse`, the value
// resolved to a spell (the engine's own name resolver) or an item (inventory
// walk) — writes the spell into that same engine field, and repaints the
// affected slots through the engine's own slot-changed notifier. The icon
// (`Macro::IconPath`, a hook on the engine's macro icon getter), tooltip
// (`Tooltip::SetAction`) and item count / cooldown / consumable overrides
// (`Action::ItemState`) read the resolution through `Lookup` / `ForSlot` /
// `LookupPassive`.
//
// Yields entirely when SuperCleveRoidMacros is loaded (it owns macro display
// with its own conditional dialect): every lookup fails, so the overrides
// pass straight through to the engine. A build that sets
// `CleveRoids.ClassicAPIMacroDisplay` drives us through `Publish` instead and
// lifts that wholesale yield.
//
// PUBLISHING. An addon with its own macro parser can hand us the resolution
// and let this module do the display work, instead of replacing
// `GetActionTexture` / `GetActionCooldown` / `IsUsableAction` / … in Lua.
// That is a strictly better deal for it: writing the spell into the engine's
// own per-macro cache is what makes cooldown, range, usable, current and
// auto-repeat correct for a macro button without a single override, and the
// icon reaches two places Lua cannot — the cursor while a macro is dragged,
// and the macro window grid — because both come from an engine getter we
// hook. A published macro is not re-parsed or re-evaluated by us, and it is
// honored even while yielding.
