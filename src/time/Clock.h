// The engine's OS millisecond tick — the ONE place the codebase reads it.
//
// `FUN_OS_TICKCOUNT_MS` (→ `GetTickCount`, or a scaled rdtsc in timing-mode 1)
// returns an **unsigned** 32-bit millisecond counter on the SAME epoch that
// Lua's `GetTime()` scales by 0.001 (`Script_GetTime` masks the tick to the
// low 32 bits UNSIGNED, then × 0.001). Two hard consequences:
//
//   1. It is UNSIGNED and wraps at 2^32 ms (~49.7 days). Reading a tick into a
//      signed `int` makes every timestamp negative once the counter passes
//      2^31 ms (~24.9 days of uptime) — and the rdtsc backend can already be
//      past 2^31 right after a warm reboot. A negative `startTime + duration`
//      then lands in the past and callers see every cooldown/aura as already
//      elapsed. This exact bug shipped three times (cooldown by-ID getters,
//      LossOfControl); it must never come back.
//
//   2. Absolute ticks are only comparable through wrap-safe arithmetic. Never
//      write `now < deadline` on two raw ticks — it inverts for the ~24.9 days
//      after a wrap. Use `Reached()` / `Remaining()` below, which take the
//      signed difference (both operands wrap together, so the delta stays
//      correct as long as the interval is under 2^31 ms — always true here).
//
// RULE: read ticks only through `Time::Clock::NowMs()` (returns `uint32_t` — do
// not store it in a signed `int`), and compare them only through the helpers
// here. Push a tick to Lua as `(double)(uint32_t)tick` so it matches
// `GetTime()*1000` across the wrap (see `Spell::Cast::PushMs`).
