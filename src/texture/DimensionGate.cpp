// Texture dimension gates — let any texture the GPU can hold load, whatever its
// size or shape, without ever letting the decoder outrun its buffer.
//
// THE INVARIANT. Every texture decode in this engine writes into ONE global
// scratch buffer (VAR_TEXTURE_DECODE_SCRATCH), allocated once at boot for a
// single square texture of side S (0x200 stock; 0x400 once VanillaHelpers has
// patched the boot immediates) and written with no bounds check. So the rule
// every client version upholds is: nothing may reach the decoder larger than
// S on either axis. They just enforce it in different places:
//
//   1.12   allocator FUN_00448450: `< 1024` AND power-of-two, together => <= 512.
//          The create validator's device-caps max is raw hardware (thousands) and
//          protects nothing — a 2560x1080 sailed through it and faulted in the
//          decoder's pixel writer at 0x004492E5.
//   3.3.5  scratch 1024; the allocator's size test is demoted to pool
//          eligibility ([32,512]) and the VALIDATOR carries the bound, because
//          3.3.5 clamps its caps max to 1024. Verified in FUN_004b7f80 /
//          FUN_00681d90 / FUN_004b5bb0. Not grow-on-demand — the same fixed
//          buffer, one size up. VanillaHelpers' patch set is, in effect, this
//          exact backport (size 0x400, scratch 0x400, pool 6x6).
//
// Two consequences this module is built around. The POT rule was PART of 1.12's
// size bound, so relaxing it alone exposes a 600x600 overrun on a stock client.
// And the POT jumps sit ABOVE the size CMPs in the allocator, so retargeting a
// POT failure straight to the pool-skip tail jumps OVER the bound.
//
// DESIGN — no numbers of our own. A fixed cap only exists because the buffer is
// sized up front; size it on demand and the cap disappears. Every dimension
// failure in the allocator — POT or size — is routed into a 24-byte code cave in
// a page we own, which hands the texture's width and height to EnsureScratch:
//
//     PUSHAD ; MOV ECX,EBX ; MOV EDX,EAX ; CALL EnsureScratch
//     TEST AL,AL ; POPAD ; JZ reject ; JMP pool-skip
//
// EnsureScratch refuses anything over the device's own max texture dimension —
// the caps field the create validator compares against, so we never grow for a
// texture the engine would refuse a moment later — and otherwise replaces the
// scratch with one that fits, through the engine's own decode-buffer
// constructor FUN_TEXTURE_DECODE_BUFFER_ALLOC (the routine both decoders use
// when the scratch is NULL). The scratch is a high-water mark: someone who never
// loads anything over 1024 pays nothing. The in-function size CMPs decide only
// "poolable" (the smaller of what the recycle pool can index and the boot
// scratch). That is 3.3.5's allocator/validator split, with the validator's
// bound honoured up front instead of relying on a caps clamp 1.12 doesn't have.
//
// Layers:
//   1. Pool eligibility follows the engine (always on). The pool limit is read
//      back from the boot immediates and the pool-count immediate, so it is
//      right on any DLL stack — the stock bucket table ends exactly at the
//      scratch pointer, so an index it can't hold reads the pointer as a list.
//   2. VanillaHelpers' pool-index stride (auto, when its 6x6 table is
//      detected). Their table is 6 wide but the index arithmetic stayed at
//      stride 5, so a 1024 dimension collides with a 32-high bucket and the
//      wrong-size texture is recycled: 32x1024 rendered nothing, 64x1024
//      worked by luck. Both index sites are rewritten to stride 6.
//   3. Grow on demand (always on) — the cave above. This is enough for TGA,
//      which allocates first and decodes later at upload.
//   4. BLP grows BEFORE it decompresses (always on). The .blp loader writes
//      the decoded image into the scratch and only then calls the allocator, so
//      the cave is too late for it — a 2048x2048 BLP has always overrun the
//      scratch on this client. A pre-hook on the decompressor FUN_BLP_DECOMPRESS,
//      which carries the dimensions itself, grows the scratch first — and
//      repoints the caller's already-copied slot at the new buffer, since the
//      decompressor writes through that copy — or reports "decompression
//      failed" for a texture the GPU can't hold. It acts only when the slot IS
//      the scratch: the IMG path decompresses into a private, right-sized
//      buffer of its own and is left untouched.
//   6. The recycle-pool free follows the same bound (always on). The free path
//      files a texture into a bucket with no upper size check; the cave lets
//      textures larger than the pool can index exist, so freeing one overran
//      the bucket table (a 2048x2048 crashed at teardown). A hook routes any
//      texture the table can't index to the non-pooled free instead — the
//      mirror of the allocator's cave, and the missing half of the size gate.
//   5. The async fallback guard (always on). FUN_TEXTURE_FORCE_LOAD shoves a
//      read that never fit the shared async buffer into a 512 KiB static
//      fallback with no size check — a pre-existing engine bug the stock size
//      gate merely hid, and the actual mechanism behind "big BLPs crash". The
//      hook refuses to force a request larger than the fallback; the texture
//      stays blank. So a BLP FILE larger than the shared buffer (2 MiB stock,
//      32 MiB with VanillaHelpers) does not load — an uncompressed BLP only;
//      DXT stays far under, and TGA is synchronous. Growing the fallback to fit
//      was tried and reverted (a reader-thread fault, not yet isolated).
//   NPOT (always on). POT failures go to the cave (fit, then fresh allocation
//      — never the pool, whose log2 index is meaningless for NPOT), and the
//      validator's own POT re-test is forced true. Verified in-game for the
//      TGA/UI path (clamped UVs, single mip); NPOT BLPs with DXT blocks or mip
//      chains are untested.
//
// Applied from module registration — glue boot and every FrameXML init — which
// is after every other DLL's load-time patching, so the values read back are
// the ones actually in force. The guard hook installs with the rest of the
// DLL's hooks.
