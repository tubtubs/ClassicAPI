// Built-in atlas bindings, derived from `UiTextureAtlas` + `UiTextureAtlasMember`
// as shipped by Classic Era 1.15.9 (build 69547). Vanilla 1.12 has no atlas table
// at all, so a modern addon's `SetAtlas("name")` has nothing to resolve against;
// each row here binds one Blizzard atlas name to the 1.12 texture that carries the
// same art, plus the sub-rect within it.
//
// WHY THIS TABLE IS TINY AND NOT FIVE THOUSAND ROWS
//
// The member table has 5,353 named regions. Almost none of them can be bound
// automatically, for three independent reasons established by measurement:
//
//   1. The sheets do not exist here. Resolving all 868 atlas sheet fileDataIDs
//      through the community listfile and testing every path against the client's
//      own art (7,640 files) gives ZERO hits — Classic Era repacked its art into
//      sheets 1.12 has never shipped.
//   2. Only the names carry over. Blizzard kept the original vanilla filename as
//      the atlas name when packing, so 16 member names match a 1.12 file basename.
//      That is the entire mechanical overlap.
//   3. A matching name does not prove matching art. Comparing the real BLP headers
//      against the member table's sprite sizes, only 5 of those 16 agree.
//      `ui-scrollbar-scrollupbutton-up` is 18x16 in the atlas while the 1.12 file
//      is 32x32 — and vanilla's own `UIPanelScrollBarButton` template draws it at
//      TexCoords 0.25,0.75,0.25,0.75, a CENTERED 16x16 sprite that is neither the
//      atlas's size nor a top-left crop. `macropopup-topleft` is 18x71 against a
//      256x256 file: a different asset that happens to share a name. So texcoords
//      cannot be derived from the two tables, and a wrong guess renders wrong art
//      rather than failing loudly.
//
// HOW A ROW GETS DERIVED
//
// Two methods, both evidence-based. Every row records which one it came from.
//
//   NAME MATCH — the atlas name IS a 1.12 filename AND the dimensions agree, so
//     the whole file is the sprite and the texcoords are a trivial 0..1. Only 5
//     names clear both bars. Do NOT skip the dimension check: 11 more names match
//     while the art does not.
//   WIDGET MATCH — the strong one. Classic Era's UI is this UI rebuilt, so the
//     same widget exists in both trees: one names its art by atlas, the other by
//     file plus TexCoords. Grep `atlas="name"` in Classic Era's exported
//     FrameXML, find the same widget in the client's own exported FrameXML, and
//     read the binding straight off it. Take the SIZE from the 1.12 file rather
//     than the member table — packing adds a pixel or two of bleed.
//
// Anything neither method reaches needs a human to pick the equivalent art by
// eye, which is the lowest-confidence case and always needs a render check.
// `C_Texture.RegisterAtlas` replaces a built-in binding at runtime, so a
// candidate row can be tested live before it is added here.
//
// Growth is driven by the miss log (`_classicapi_DumpAtlasMisses`), never done
// speculatively, so the table only ever moves toward what real addons ask for.
//
// Two source-data traps, handled during extraction:
//   - 28 members have an EMPTY name and must be skipped.
//   - 73 names repeat case-insensitively; keep the higher ID, the same rule
//     `ui/ColorData.h` documents for duplicate color tags.
//
// `tilesHorizontally` / `tilesVertically` come from `CommittedFlags` bits 0 and 1.
// They are stored as resolved booleans rather than the raw flags word because the
// other set bits (4, 8, 16 appear in the data) have no known meaning and must not
// leak into the public contract.
