// `AddOns::LoadState` — tracks which addons are mid-load.
//
// The engine's own "loaded" byte (`entry+0x18`) is set at the START of a
// load, before the addon's files run, so on its own it can't tell
// "loading" from "loaded". That distinction is observable: an addon's
// file-scope code, and every dependency pulled in during it, execute
// while the byte already reads set.
//
// A co-hook on the per-addon loader keeps a stack of the names currently
// being loaded, which is the missing half of
// `C_AddOns.IsAddOnLoaded`'s `(loadedOrLoading, loaded)` pair.
namespace AddOns::LoadState {

// True while `name` is inside the engine's per-addon load call. Matching
// is case-insensitive, as addon-name matching is everywhere else.
bool IsLoading(const char *name);

} // namespace AddOns::LoadState
