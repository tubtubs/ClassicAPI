// Turtle WoW server-side aura duration mods that the client can't hear.
// These mirror server mechanics that change a DoT's remaining time on another
// unit with no client-visible packet (verified in tortoise-wow: the edit goes
// through SetAuraDuration / RefreshHolder, which notifies only the aura's
// target-if-a-player, never the observing caster). We can't hear the change,
// but we see the triggering cast's SMSG_SPELL_GO, so Aura::Source mirrors the
// edit on the cached entry. A rule is a { exact trigger spellID -> affected
// aura by SpellFamilyName plus a family-flag overlap and/or a SpellIconID }
// pair, applied by Aura::Source::ApplyDurationModifiers.
//
//   Conflagrate   -> Immolate:       shave 3s   (Turtle keeps Immolate ticking, -3s;
//                                                stock's full-consume removes it, which
//                                                OnAuraRemoved evicts, so the rule is
//                                                harmless there)
//   Molten Blast  -> Flame Shock:    refresh    (RefreshHolder -> reset to full)
//   Bestial Wrath -> Scent of Blood: set to Bestial Wrath's own duration
//
// Gated on Turtle::Detected() and registered once (a WorldTick latch, since the
// gate reads a FrameXML global only present in-world). Stock's Conflagrate
// still exists, so keeping the gate preserves the previous Lua behaviour
// exactly; Molten Blast's spell IDs don't exist off Turtle anyway.

// `holder->SetAuraMaxDuration/SetAuraDuration` on the pet's existing holder —
// both are plain field writes that send nothing, and the one duration packet
// 1.12 has is scoped to an aura-bearer that is a PLAYER, which a pet is not.
// So the client keeps showing the 8s it computed at application and the timer
// simply runs out under a buff that is still up.
//
// The trigger is visible, though, and Bestial Wrath's implicit target is
// TARGET_UNIT_CASTER_PET, so the pet is in its SMSG_SPELL_GO hit list and the
