// Turtle WoW "Stinging Nettle" hunter talent (talent 403; rank passives
// 51579 / 51580): Mongoose Bite and triggered fire traps apply the hunter's
// highest known Serpent Sting rank at 20% (R1) / 40% (R2) of its duration.
//
// Server-side (tortoise-wow spell_hunter.cpp ApplyStingingNettle) the sting
// is a direct `target->AddAura(...)` — no cast, no SMSG_SPELL_GO for the
// sting itself — so the client sees only the descriptor application and
// OnAuraAdded would seat it caster-less at the full 15s base. The TRIGGERS
// are visible, though: Mongoose Bite is a real player cast, and the
// fire-trap effect spells are cast by the trap's OWNER (GameObject::Use
// TYPE_TRAP → pOwner->CastSpell) with non-zero SpellVisual, so they pass
// IsNeedSendToClient and their SMSG_SPELL_GO broadcasts with the hunter as
// caster and the victim in the hit list. Registered as Aura::Source
// triggered-application rules: the trigger arms its hit targets, and the
// caster-less Serpent Sting application that follows consumes the arm
// (player attribution + the server's max(1, base × pct / 100)).
//
// The rank gates are the talent-granted passives, read live from the
// spell-knowledge bitmap at trigger time (respec-safe); R2 registers first
// so its 40% wins while known. The percents come from the rank spells' own
// EffectBasePoints[0] + 1 — the same DBC value the server's
// CalculateSimpleValue reads (19 → 20%, 39 → 40%), with the server's own
// 20/40 fallback — so a Turtle rebalance that patches the client DBC tracks
// automatically.
//
// Server guards that mirror for free: no talent → no arm (gate fails, and
// the server applies nothing); an existing LONGER sting → the server skips
// AddAura entirely → no application event → the arm just expires. A nettle
// re-apply over a SHORTER existing sting reuses the descriptor slot (no
// OnAuraAdded, verified in-game with chained Mongoose Bites), so the arm
// mechanism additionally refreshes the existing cached entry at trigger
// time, mirroring the server's keep-the-longer rule — see
// RefreshTriggeredExisting in aura/Source.cpp. Other hunters' nettle stings
// stay at base duration (their talents aren't client-knowable).
//
// Gated on Turtle::Detected() via a WorldTick latch, like DurationMods —
// the trigger spells exist on stock 1.12, but the mechanic is Turtle's.
