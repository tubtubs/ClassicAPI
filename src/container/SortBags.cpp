// `C_Container.SortBags()` — arrange the player's bags.
//
// Two phases, because every item move is a server round trip and the
// second phase has to read slot contents the first phase changed.
//
// PHASE ONE consolidates partial stacks, and hands that entirely to the
// server: one `CMSG_AUTOSTORE_BAG_ITEM` per redundant stack, which
// merges into existing stacks of the same item and splits across several
// of them when that is what fits. Nothing here computes what fits, so
// nothing here needs an item's max stack size — which matters, because
// that number is unavailable until the item's data has arrived from the
// server, and a merge that sizes stacks first silently skips the ones it
// could not size.
//
// PHASE TWO places items. It runs on the next `Bag::UpdateDelayed` — the
// engine's own "a bag changed this frame" signal — so the merges are
// settled before anything is read. It plans the whole layout up front
// and then tracks each item's live position as swaps fire, rather than
// re-reading a layout it is in the middle of mutating. Our swap is
// fire-and-forget and sets no client-side item lock, so the whole batch
// goes out in one frame.
//
// Neither phase may touch the Lua stack: phase two runs from a bag-update
// callback, outside any Lua call, where the engine may have its own
// values on the stack. Hence the `*From` senders and the direct invMgr
// walk rather than `ResolveBag`.
//
// THE ORDERING IS OURS. Retail computes it in code we cannot read, and
// its categories (per-bag assignment flags, expansion filters) have no
// counterpart here, so this is a defensible order rather than a
// reproduction of Blizzard's: hearthstone, gear, consumables, reagents,
// trade goods, quest items, everything else by quality, junk last. Within
// a category, by item class, subclass, name, then fuller stacks first.
// Gear adds two keys so like pieces sit together: the equip slot right
// after the class (kSlotOrder), and quality, best first, before the name.
//
// An item whose data has NOT arrived is pinned: left where it is, with
// its slot withheld from the destination pool so nothing else is planned
// into it. It cannot be ranked without a class, quality and name, and
// guessing scatters it. A later call places it once the data lands. Phase
// one is unaffected, since it needs only the item ID.

// Why this is computed here rather than delegated to the server's own
// autostore, which can merge a stack into several destinations for one

//
// `CMSG_AUTOSTORE_BAG_ITEM` names its destination with a container byte,
// and the only value the engine's builder will emit for "the player" is
// `INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0` (255). Server-side that is NOT the search-every-
// bag path — that one is `NULL_BAG` (0), which the builder cannot
// express. 255 takes the specific-container branch, which searches the
// keyring and the backpack and nothing else. So autostore can never
// merge a stack in one equipped bag with a stack in another, which is
// most of the real cases.
//
// Addressing both endpoints explicitly costs a packet per transfer
// instead of per emptied source — occasionally one more, when a stack
// has to be split across several destinations — and works everywhere.

// Bank consolidation has to be computed here. `CMSG_AUTOSTORE_BANK_ITEM`
// always CROSSES the inventory/bank boundary — a bank-sourced item
// travels out to the bags — so there is no "find this a fuller stack
// inside the bank" packet to delegate to. This is the one place the
// protocol forces a client-side merge, and it carries the cost that
// comes with that: it needs each item's max stack size, which is
// unavailable until that item's data has arrived, so a stack we cannot
