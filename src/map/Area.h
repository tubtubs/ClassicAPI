// row is the client's per-zone map descriptor (directory name + the

// reader that keys off "which zone" resolves a row first. Both
// `Map::Overlays` (GetMapOverlays) and `Map::WorldSize` (GetMapWorldSize)
// go through here so the two ways of naming a zone — an AreaTable areaID
// argument, or the world map's current continent/zone view — live in one

// `WorldMapDetailTile` textures is 256x256 (tile 5 anchors below tile 1, so
// the grid is 4 wide by 3 tall). A map's background is that grid, and
// `WorldMapOverlay` placement/hit rects are authored in the same space.
//
// These are deliberately CONSTANTS rather than a live read of
// `WorldMapDetailFrame`, which would look like the more "engine-driven"
// choice and is in fact the wrong one, twice over:
//
//   - The frame is addon-mutable. Map addons resize and rescale it, but the
//     DBC coordinates these normalize don't move — they were authored
//     against the shipped size. Reading the frame live would silently skew
//     every overlay the moment someone scaled the map.
//   - They are LOGICAL sizes, not on-disk ones. An HD map patch ships
//     larger tile files; `Map::Overlays` detects that from the real BLP
//     dimensions and scales. Reporting a patched tile's true size here
//     would break the `canvas / tile` division that yields the 4x3 grid.
//
// So the authored value is the truth, and the runtime one is the mutable
// approximation — the reverse of the usual case.
